This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Parent Class**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.\n",
      "2. **Child Class**: The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class ParentClass:\n",
      "    # Parent class methods and attributes\n",
      "\n",
      "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
      "    # Child class methods and attributes\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Animal:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
      "        self.name = name\n",
      "\n",
      "    def speak(self):\n",
      "        print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound\")\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Method Overriding**: Child classes can override methods from the parent class, allowing for specialized behavior.\n",
      "- **Use of `super()`**: You can use the `super()` function to call the methods of the parent class.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits\n",

The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, had imposed harsh penalties on Germany, leading to economic hardship and political instability. This created conditions ripe for the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party, who promised to restore Germany to its former glory.\n",

      "1. **Treaty of Versailles**: Placed heavy reparations on Germany, leading to economic struggle and resentment.\n",

      "2. **Rise of Totalitarian Regimes**: In Germany, Italy, and Japan, authoritarian leaders pursued aggressive expansionist policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expansionism**: Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 directly triggered the war. Prior violations included reoccupation of the Rhineland, annexation of Austria, and the Munich Agreement's breach concerning Czechoslovakia.\n",

      "4. **Failure of Appeasement**: The Allies, particularly Britain and France, initially adopted a policy of appeasement, allowing Hitler to expand German territory in hopes of avoiding conflict.\n",
